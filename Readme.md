## Overview

This project aims to provide actionable insights from the Ola dataset by:

- Analyzing data using SQL.
- Designing an interactive dashboard in Power BI to visualize key metrics.
- Identifying trends and patterns to support data-driven decision-making.

## Features

- **SQL Queries:** SQL scripts to analyze the dataset and extract meaningful insights.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** A Power BI dashboard to explore booking trends, revenue, and customer activity.
- **Insights:** Analysis of key metrics such as peak booking times, popular routes, and revenue distribution.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes information on:

- Booking IDs
- Ride details (date, time, route, and distance)
- Customer information
- Payment details

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ola-bookings-analysis.git
   ```

2. **Prepare the Environment:**

   - Install SQL Server or any compatible database engine.
   - Install Power BI Desktop.

3. **Import the Dataset:**

   - Load the dataset into your SQL database.
   - Execute the provided SQL script (`Ola Booking Analysis.sql`) to prepare the data.

4. **Open the Dashboard:**

   - Use Power BI Desktop to open the `Ola Bookings Analysis.pbix` file.

## Usage

1. Execute the SQL script to analyze the data.
2. Open the Power BI dashboard to explore the visualizations.
3. Use filters and slicers to analyze specific metrics.

## Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard includes:

- **Ride Volume:** Daily and monthly booking trends.
- **Revenue Insights:** Total revenue, average ride cost, and revenue by route.
- **Customer Analysis:** Most frequent customers and booking preferences.
- **Operational Metrics:** Average ride time, distance, and route efficiency.

## SQL Queries

The SQL script performs the following tasks:

- Analysis of booking trends.
- Identification of top customers and popular routes.
- Evaluation of ride cancellations and operational efficiency.

## Key Insights

Based on the SQL analysis and Power BI dashboard:

1. **Booking Trends:** Higher ride volumes during weekends and evenings.
2. **Revenue Distribution:** A significant portion of revenue comes from long-distance rides.
3. **Customer Behavior:** A few customers account for the majority of bookings, highlighting loyalty or frequent use.
4. **Operational Insights:** Popular routes indicate areas of higher demand, while cancelled rides provide opportunities for service improvement.
